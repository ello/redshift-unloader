# Redshift Unloader

This is a simple schedulable script that lets us unload (or reload) data from Redshift to S3 month-by-month.

It's useful for automatically archiving data outside of a given retention window (i.e. 1y). 


## Configuring

The script relies on a handful of environment variables - 

- `REDSHIFT_URL` - URL to use to connect to the target Redshift instance/database
- `REDSHIFT_ROLE_ARN` - an AWS IAM role attached to the cluster with access to the S3 bucket. See [the AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/loading-data-access-permissions.html) for details on setting this up.
- `S3_BUCKET` - the bucket to unload data into
- `ONLY_TABLES` - (optional) comma-separated list of fully-qualified (i.e. schema.tablename) tables to limit unload operations to
- `UNLOAD_ONLY` - (optional) only unload data, don't delete it

With those set, you can run the following Rake tasks:

- `rake redshift:list_tables` - list all tables in the database along with the count of archivable rows in each
- `rake redshift:unload_all` - unload all tables in the database with eligible data to the specified S3 bucket

## Setup

You'll need a working Ruby 2.3 setup with Bundler

Once those are set up, you can install dependencies with `bundle install`.
