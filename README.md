# Redshift Pruner

This is a simple schedulable script that lets us remove outdated [Segment Warehouse](https://segment.com/warehouses) data from Redshift.

It's useful for automatically archiving data outside of a given retention window (i.e. after 6 months). 


## Configuring

The script relies on a handful of environment variables - 

- `REDSHIFT_URL` - URL to use to connect to the target Redshift instance/database
- `ONLY_TABLES` - (optional) comma-separated list of fully-qualified (i.e. schema.tablename) tables to which to limit pruning operations
- `RETENTION_INTERVAL` - (optional, defaults to `365 days`) prune data older than this time ago, as specified by a [Postgres interval value](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/datatype-datetime.html)

With those set, you can run the following Rake tasks:

- `rake redshift:list_tables` - list all tables in the database along with the count of prunable rows in each
- `rake redshift:prune_all` - prune data older than the specified threshold from all tables in the database

## Setup

You'll need a working Ruby 2.3 setup with Bundler

Once those are set up, you can install dependencies with `bundle install`.
